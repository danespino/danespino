**`FullStack Developer (Laravel/JS (React, Angular)) & Tech Support Engineer @ Tek-Experts`**

Hello Devs 👋💻, this is Dan. I'm happy to see you around here 😉. I'm building my tech career as a content creator and independent programmer 🧑‍💻. I have professional experience as a developer using various programming languages and working remotely. Currently, I'm a Tech Support Engineer at Tek-Experts El Salvador, and in my free time, I'm working on a few side projects and creating media content to help others and showcase my expertise to the world.

My tech interests are quite varied, as I've been involved in tech during different "ages." I started my journey when I was 13, took a break to earn my BA Degree 👨‍🎓, and learned a lot about Finance, Project Management, and related business topics 🧑‍💼😎📈. I'm particularly interested in Web Development and still fascinated by Operating System Design and Creation. If you want to know more about my interests, you can check out my YouTube channel, which will be a High-Fidelity Digital Diary.

I would love it if you could check out what I'm working on and show some support 😊🙏. Greetings to everyone, and I hope you find some cool/helpful stuff here.
